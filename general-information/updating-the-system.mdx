title: "Updating the System"
---

All updates with KOR are seamlessly done on the backend environment, so constant updating is usually not required. Users will always have the latest updates when attaching the system.

### LSL Script Updates
In the occurrence where LSL scripts require updating, you will be prompted upon attaching the controller. 

If prompted, you must:
1. Go to a designated update location.
2. Run the command `!update`.

<Warning>
Failure to update the controller will result in being prompted to update the system on every attach, and your user experience could be degraded.
