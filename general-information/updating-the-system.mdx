title: "Updating the System"
---

KOR performs all updates on the backend environment, so constant updating is not required. You will always have the latest updates when attaching the system.

### LSL Script Updates
When LSL scripts require updating, the system prompts you upon attaching the controller. 

If prompted:
1. Go to a designated update location.
2. Run the command `!update`.

<Warning>
If you do not update the controller, the system will prompt you to update on every attach, and your user experience may be degraded.
</Warning>
