title: "User Interface"

<Note>
  The User Interface is still under development. This is a simple dashboard with select features enabled for customization.
</Note>

## Moving the UI
By clicking and holding the top or the sides, you are able to drag the interface around your screen. Wherever you leave it is where it will stay until moved again.

<Tip>
  If you lose the UI or it goes off-screen, use the command `!reset ui` to reset it back to the middle of your screen.
</Tip>

## Resizing the UI
If you want to resize the UI interface, refer to the SL dialog that pops up when you open the interface. When you click on **Scale**, it allows you to scale it on the X or Y axis if the window is too small for your monitor.
