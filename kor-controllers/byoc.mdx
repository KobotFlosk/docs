title: "KOR BYOC (Build Your Own Controller)"
---

This kit allows the user to make their own controller.

<Warning>
  All instructions must be followed exactly else the system will not function or unexpected behaviors may ensue. Perform all steps below on the ground.
</Warning>

<Note>
  **AS OF JAN 4, 2026:** BYOC does not require an external battery. BYOC is now a plasma-based system.
</Note>

### Requirements

<Warning>
  **Minimum of 7 prims linked together.** (6 + 1 Root Prim)
  
  Prim(s) must have Next Owner permission set to **'Modify'** and **'Copy'** ONLY.
  *(Else scripts will throw a debug message of "failed to start" upon dropping in)*

  **Next owner permissions:**
  * [x] Modify
  * [x] Copy
  * [ ] Transfer
</Warning>

- All prims containing scripts must have unique names:
  - One prim must be named `'system.main'`.
  - One prim must be named `'K_Surface'` (This is how others and yourself access the controller by touching).
  - One prim must be named `'K_Storage'`.
  - Rename the remaining 3 prims to something unique (e.g., `DS1`, `DS2`, `DS3`). They **CANNOT** all be named 'Object'.

### Installation Steps

All scripts prefixed with 'KOR' (and 'KOCORE') should be placed in the **root prim** unless otherwise specified.

1. **'system.main' prim**: Place `system.main` and `keep.alive` scripts.
2. **Gateway Prims**: Place `KOR.gateway` script in three separate prims without any other scripts.
3. **'K_Surface' prim**: Place `KOR.interact` script here.
4. **'K_Storage' prim**: Place `KOR.content` and `KOR.input` scripts. Also place updater prim, animations, and notecards here.
5. **Description**: Place your encrypted token in the `system.main` prim description.
```Encrypted Token:
z8/uKDmPH6iFLs5sEJqUeeX0ZIOd+eBLHHvIWtSAlME=
```
6. **Finalize**: Pick up the object and attach to the **Chest** attachment point.
