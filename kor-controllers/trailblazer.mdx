### Must Knows

This controller has **OPTIONAL** position saving which must be enabled by running the command [**!prsxyz**](/getting-started/command-reference) after booting and positioning your controller. Otherwise if you choose to not save the position you are free to move it about your avatar with no issue.

* This controller **REQUIRES** a battery. Battery is only included as a 'kit' if purchased in-world. Otherwise Marketplace sales require a separate purchase.
* Nanite System Batteries are compatible.
