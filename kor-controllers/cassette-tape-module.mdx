### What am I able to do?

Other users in-world will be able to interact with your tape module by simply touching the buttons on your back, or if they are an owner they can run the [commands](/getting-started/command-reference) to access your menus.

**Buttons on the face of the controller:**
* Play (starts/boots the unit)
* Stop (halts the unit)
* Eject (shuts down the unit and the cassette falls out)

## Must knows

This controller has **OPTIONAL** position saving which must be enabled by running the command [**!prsxyz**](/getting-started/command-reference) after booting and positioning your controller. Otherwise if you choose to not save the position you are free to move it about your avatar with no issue.

* This controller has a **NON-REMOVABLE** Electric Battery.
