### What am I able to do?

Other users in-world will be able to interact with your key by simply touching the key on your back, or if they are an owner they can run the [commands](/getting-started/command-reference) to access your menus.

**Options a User would receive if clicked.**
* Turn Key
* Take Key
* Jam Key

If the user decides to **Turn Key** it will add tension to the spring; as in winding the doll up.

If the user decides to **Take Key** it will cause the key on the back of the doll to disappear and rez out onto the ground to be taken by the user. It will attach to your right hand if accepted.

<Warning>
Rez rights are required for **Take Key** to work properly, otherwise you will be prompted with a notice that it failed to rez.
</Warning>

If the user decides to **Jam Key** it will cause the doll to cease functioning until the key is unjammed.

<Note>
RLV is required for **Jam Key** to work effectively and provide the realism the system provides.

### Increasing Time

<Note>
By default every KOR Nexus Key will be preloaded to 4 hours.
</Note>

You can either click on the key itself, or you can run the command **!menu** *(You will need to click on devices within the menu)* or **!menu devices** to bring you straight there.

Look for the device named '**Spring Power**' once located click on the device.

Within this menu you will have the option to **Adjust Time** inside this menu you will be presented with this dialog.

You have the choice to either increase or decrease the amount of time the key will last being while being 100% wound.

<Warning>
If increasing the capacity beyond the original 4 hours, you will be required to be wound up by someone. There is no maximum to how long your doll key can last.
</Warning>

### How to Mute/Unmute the Ticking

If the ticking is too obnoxious for yourself or others you can easily mute and unmute the noise by running this command `!mute passive` or `!unmute passive`

---

### Teleporting (QTT)

Every QTT a doll does while the key is worn will deduct 1/6th of the capacity set on the key. So be weary using QTT uses quite a bit of spring tension.

---

### Key Winding

The doll itself is not allowed to wind their own key. Another user is required to wind the key.

Upon winding the key it will spit out into local chat who wound the key, and the percentage it was wound up to.

<Note>
Keep in mind over-winding the key beyond 100% has a 20% chance of snapping the key and it will unwound the spring to a random percentage.
