---

### How does it work?
This easy-to-use charger provides two functions of charging by simply sitting on the charger:

- **Charge:** This allows for slow direct charging to the unit. (Less battery degradation).
- **Capacitive Charge:** This allows for instant charging in a pinch. Any percentage your unit is at will be charged to 100% within seconds. 
  <Note>K.I.S.S is not liable for damages!</Note>
- **Disconnect:** This will unlock motors and allow the unit to get off the charger.

### Tweak the Charge Speed
By sitting on the charger and clicking on **Settings** → **Toggle Charge Speed**, you can change how many KJ's will be charged to the unit per second.

### Group Access
First, you need to set a group on the charger. Once this is done, you can sit on the charger and navigate to **Settings** → **Group Access** to toggle the option **ON**.

### Setting the Charger Color
By default, the charger takes on the unit's Primary Color when the unit is placed on it. To change the charger's color:
1. Set the unit's Primary Color to the desired color.
2. Click **"Set Color"** on the charger. 
3. The charger will save this color. 

To revert to the unit's Primary Color, set the unit's color to white to reset the charger.
