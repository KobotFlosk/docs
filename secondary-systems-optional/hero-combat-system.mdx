### What is HERO? 
HERO is an acronym for **Hybridized Elite Robotic Operatives**. It is our advanced and hyper-realistic combat system.

### How does it work?
Upon attaching the controller for the first time HERO will be disabled by default. So if you're wanting it enabled you will need to follow these steps to enable the feature.

1. Open up your **Main Menu**
2. Go into **Manage** → **HERO** 
3. Toggle it **ON**.

<Note>
Once HERO is turned on you will take damage from numerous sources: projectiles, ATOS objects, and fall damage.
</Note>

 Once HERO is ON every unit has a baseline of 1000 integrity points, once you hit 0 you're dead. 

### Damage Multipliers

HERO takes into account bullet material types and damage is scaled based on these values. Most bullets on SL are usually Wood, but if you would like to take advantage of the multipliers see scales below.

| Material | Damage Scale |
| :--- | :--- |
| Flesh | 10% |
| Glass | 90% |
| Metal | 200% |
| Plastic | 50% |
| Rubber | 30% |
| Stone | 120% |
| Wood | 100% |

<Note>
  Damage is calculated as: `Base Damage * Multiplier`.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Once dead the system will automatically repair itself within 20 seconds and the system will reboot. It is imperative that you repair immediately as you will only revive with 10% integrity.
</Warning>

### Compatibility
- HERO is compatible with **Nanite's ATOS** integration. So if you have Nanite repair tables, or even weapons they are compatible with the HERO implementation.
- HERO is also compatible with **VICE** damages and **SL** damages; and has been scaled accordingly to meet our standards.

<Warning>
With HERO being a brand new implementation, bugs will be possible. If there is anything that does not work as intended please make it known in the Discord so it can be handled accordingly.
</Warning>
