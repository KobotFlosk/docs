title: "KOR Display Case"
---

<Warning>
This is an RLV based device. RLV is not required for use, but loses a lot of functionality.
</Warning>

### How does it work?

There are two different ways to interact with the display case.

If you click and hold, then release after 1-2 seconds, a menu will appear showing nearby agents that can be grabbed and placed inside the case.

<Note>
Any KOR Controller must be worn for this to work.
</Note>

Clicking the case once will open the door, allowing you to sit inside. Right-clicking to sit will not work; the door must be open for sitting to be possible.

### Group Permissions

To retain access to a specific group, you must set the display case to that group. Only members of the assigned group will have access to interact with the case as permitted; and basically act as an owner of the case.

#### Owner Access
* The case owner will always have access, regardless of group settings.
* The owner has the ability to modify settings, adjust permissions, and manage case interactions.

#### Forced Sitting and Restrictions
* Only the **owner** can force another user to sit inside the case.
* Users who are force-sat into the case **will not be able to exit** on their own.
* This restriction is absolute unless manually released by the owner.

#### Emergency Release Command
If you become stuck inside the case and need to exit, use the command `!charger release`

#### This command will:
* Free your servos.
* Remove any **RLV restrictions**.
* Allow you to exit the case.

This command should only be used in rare cases where manual release by the owner is not possible.

### Adding Animations

<Note>
Basic knowledge of editing objects in world is required.
</Note>

If you right-click and edit the display case, navigate to link #12, named `K_Content`. Simply drag and drop any animations you want inside the display case. Once seated and the menu is accessed, the animations you added should appear.

The last animation used in the display case will always be the default for the next person who sits inside.

#### Pose Adjustment
Poses are synced through KOR's backend, meaning they will be remembered across different locations on the grid or region as long as the same poses are available.
