title: "Auxiliary Power"

Auxiliary power is a new sub-system designed to activate when a unit's power drops below 5%. 

It provides an additional 10% battery, allowing the unit to boot up and giving it enough time to reach a charger before needing user assistance. This serves as a failsafe to ensure a better user experience.
