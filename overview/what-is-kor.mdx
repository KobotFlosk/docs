KOR is a Second Life Synthetic Controller system designed for synthetic and robot role-play. It provides a high-performance, thin-client model, advanced RLV Relay, and over-the-air updates.

<Warning>
**RLV Required**: KOR requires Restrained Love Viewer (RLV) to function. You must use an RLV-compatible viewer such as Firestorm with RLV enabled.
</Warning>

KOR is compatible with Nanite Systems products, making it suitable for users seeking interactive synthetic and robot role-play.

## What is a thin-client?

A thin-client system means that the majority of the heavy lifting and processing is handled by an external server rather than locally within Second Life scripts. This approach significantly reduces lag and improves performance, allowing for a more stable and reliable experience even in complex environments.

## Is KOR safe?

KOR prioritizes user safety and data privacy. All communications between the system and the external server are encrypted, ensuring that user data remains secure and private. This encryption acts as a safeguard, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information. 

Additionally, KOR implements a robust data retention policy, where logs are automatically wiped after 5 days. This not only enhances privacy but also aids in efficient troubleshooting and seamless updates. These features demonstrate KOR's commitment to providing a secure and reliable experience in Second Life.
