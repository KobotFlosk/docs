KOR is a cutting-edge SL (Second Life) Synthetic Controller system, specifically designed to enhance the realism and immersion in synthetic and robot role-play. It provides seamless integration within Second Life, offering a high-performance, thin-client model, advanced RLV Relay for more engaging interactions, and convenient over-the-air updates. 

KOR's compatibility with Nanite Systems products further enriches your Second Life experience, making it ideal for those seeking a more authentic and interactive synthetic and robot role-play.

## What is a thin-client?

A thin-client system means that the majority of the heavy lifting and processing is handled by an external server rather than locally within Second Life scripts. This approach significantly reduces lag and improves performance, allowing for a more stable and reliable experience even in complex environments.

## Is KOR safe?

KOR prioritizes user safety and data privacy. All communications between the system and the external server are encrypted, ensuring that user data remains secure and private. This encryption acts as a safeguard, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information. 

Additionally, KOR implements a robust data retention policy, where logs are automatically wiped after 5 days. This not only enhances privacy but also aids in efficient troubleshooting and seamless updates. These features demonstrate KOR's commitment to providing a secure and reliable experience in Second Life.
