KOR is a Second Life Synthetic Controller system designed for synthetic and robot role-play. It provides a high-performance, thin-client model, advanced RLV Relay, and over-the-air updates.

<Warning>
**RLV Required**: KOR requires Restrained Love Viewer (RLV) to function. You must use an RLV-compatible viewer such as Firestorm with RLV enabled.
</Warning>

KOR is compatible with Nanite Systems products, making it suitable for users seeking interactive synthetic and robot role-play.

## What is a thin-client?

A thin-client system means that the majority of the heavy lifting and processing is handled by an external server rather than locally within Second Life scripts. This approach significantly reduces lag and improves performance, allowing for a more stable and reliable experience even in complex environments.

## Is KOR safe?

KOR encrypts all communications between the system and the external server to ensure user data remains secure and private. This encryption prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information.

KOR automatically wipes logs after 5 days. This enhances privacy and aids in efficient troubleshooting and updates.
