  <Accordion title="How do I get my NS battery to work with KOR?">
    If you are using a NS Battery make sure it is "pushed in" by clicking on the battery to make sure it is inserted. If it is, try reattaching it or running the command `|probe`. The KOR Lith Battery will automatically be detected by the system during the initial start-up and no probe is required.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the KOR Controller NS compatible?">
    This system is 100% compatible with all Nanite System products to a degree! If there is an item that is not functioning as it should, please let us know.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the KOR Controller have an RLV Relay?">
    Yes! This RLV Relay is way beyond any RLV Relay you have probably tried... this system gives you full customizability as to what objects, owners, creators, and even sims have permissions over you!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Weather & Temperature?">
    KOR takes advantage of the NS Weather stations, and even heat calculations based on what attachments you have on. Temperature is not fully implemented yet.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does 'matrix connected...' mean?">
    Whenever you login or teleport, you will receive this message advising you that the controller has gotten a new URL allowing it to communicate with the back-end.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about my Hive/Collective?">
    Hives/Collectives are supported in this system. You can communicate with other members by simply using `|hive` and enjoy speaking freely no matter where you are across the SL Grid.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I turn off the chat Redirect?">
    You would need to run the command `!releasechat` and this will release the RLV redirect. If you want to turn this feature back on, you need to use the last 4 digits of your serial number like this: `/2705 grabchat` (where 2705 is YOUR serial number).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I load the KOR Dashboard in my own browser?">
    Currently, it can only be opened within SL. In the future, we are looking to make this a viable option for users who want to manage their units outside of SL.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Help! My controller will not start up">
    In most cases, the system will auto-correct itself from any kind of errors it encounters. If it doesn't, reattaching the system is required. Due to it being run on a server outside of SL, there may be some old data coming in from a previous session, and reattaching it a second time may be required.
