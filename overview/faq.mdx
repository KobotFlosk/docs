  <Accordion title="How do I get my NS battery to work with KOR?">
    If you use an NS Battery, click on the battery to ensure it is inserted. If it is inserted, try reattaching it or running the command `|probe`. The system automatically detects the KOR Lith Battery during initial start-up and does not require a probe.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is the KOR Controller NS compatible?">
    KOR is approximately 95% compatible with all Nanite System products. If an item does not function as expected, contact support.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the KOR Controller have an RLV Relay?">
    Yes. The RLV Relay provides full customization for what objects, owners, creators, and sims have permissions over you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Weather & Temperature?">
    KOR uses NS Weather stations and calculates heat based on your attachments. Temperature is not fully implemented yet.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does 'matrix connected...' mean?">
    When you log in or teleport, you receive this message indicating that the controller has obtained a new URL to communicate with the back-end.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about my Hive/Collective?">
    KOR supports Hives/Collectives. You can communicate with other members using `|hive` from anywhere across the Second Life Grid.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I turn off the chat Redirect?">
    Run the command `!releasechat` to release the RLV redirect. To turn this feature back on, use the last 4 digits of your serial number like this: `/2705 grabchat` (where 2705 is your serial number).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I load the KOR Dashboard in my own browser?">
    Currently, you can only open the dashboard within Second Life. Future updates may allow users to manage their units outside of Second Life.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Help! My controller will not start up">
    In most cases, the system auto-corrects errors. If it does not, reattach the system. Because the system runs on a server outside of Second Life, old data from a previous session may persist, requiring a second reattachment.
