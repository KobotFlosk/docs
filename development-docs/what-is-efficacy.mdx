title: "What is Efficacy?"
---

Efficacy is the effectiveness of a received charge amount relative to the charge limit, calculated as **Charge Amount / Charge Received**. For a battery, the charge limit is 1% of its capacity. 

Efficacy varies based on the charge received compared to the maximum possible charge, with examples demonstrating how efficacy decreases as the received charge exceeds the battery's charge limit.

<Note>
**Numeric values are defined in Watts; 1W = 1000J**

* **Charge Efficacy** is the effectiveness (determined by charge limit) of a received charge amount and calculated by: `Charge Amount / Charge Received`
* **Charge limit (for Battery)** is 1% of Capacity (e.g., 1000W Battery, 10W is maximum that can be received)

### Examples of Charge Efficacy using 1000W Battery

**Example I:**
```text
Given 1000W Battery
When receiving 500W charge
Then maximum charge is 10W
And efficacy is 2%
```

**Example II:**
```text
Given 1000W Battery
When receiving 100W charge
Then maximum charge is 10W
And efficacy is 10%
```

**Example III:**
```text
Given 1000W Battery
When receiving 10W charge
Then maximum charge is 10W
And efficacy is 100%
```

**Example IV:**
```text
Given 1000W Battery
When receiving 5W charge
Then maximum charge is 5W
And efficacy is 100%
```
