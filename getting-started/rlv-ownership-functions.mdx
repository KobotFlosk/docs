</Note>

This page details the RLV functions available in the system concerning Ownership. It covers the different tiers of access and how to manage these settings.

### Access Tiers

| Tier | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Master** | **Control Level: Highest.** Unit requires assistance for most actions and has no system access unless using a safeword command to relinquish control. |
| **Owner** | **Control Level: Full.** Complete access to unit functions and settings, but the unit retains self-control. |
| **Power** | **Control Level: Moderate.** Access to specific areas once confirmed, and the unit retains self-control. |
| **Basic** | **Control Level: Limited.** Prompts the unit for permission each time someone accesses a menu, and the unit retains self-control. (View only mode with constant prompts). |

### RLV Functions for Owner and Master Access Tiers

**Owner Access:**
- **Force Teleport:** Teleport the unit to your location from anywhere, overriding their control.
- **Force Sit/Unsit:** Make the unit sit on or stand from objects without their consent.
- **Forced Animations:** With some controllers, you can make the unit perform specific animations. The unit cannot stop these animations unless the controlling user ends them.

**Master Access:**
- Full Control: Includes all Owner access functions plus additional restrictions.
- No Self-Control: The unit cannot regain control without assistance, unless using a safeword command.

### Relinquishing Control and Safe-Word Commands

**Relinquishing Control:**
If the unit needs to regain control from their Master, they can use the following commands:
- **Command:** `!go-rogue`
- **Alternative:** `/#### go-rogue` (Replace `####` with the last four digits of your serial number)

### Using the RLV Safe-Word
In case the unit gets stuck on RLV furniture or devices, they can use a safe-word to regain control. The default safe-word is **"RED"**, but it can be changed. 

- **Command:** `!relay RED`
- **Alternative:** `/#### relay RED` (Replace `####` with the last four digits of your serial number)

### Changing the Safe-Word
To set a new safe-word, navigate through the menu structure:
**Path:** `Menu` > `Manage` > `RLV` > `Safeword`

## KOR Permission System

When another user clicks on the back of any of the KOR Controllers, the unit will be prompted with an access dialog.

### Access Types

Below is a chart of how the permission system is structured:

| Access Type | What it does |

| **15 Minute** | Grants the user 15 minutes of basic access. |
| **Permanent** | Provides permanent access without prompting the unit. |
| **Blacklist** | Prevents a user from ever accessing the controller. |
