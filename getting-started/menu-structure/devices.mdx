title: "Devices"
---

Any devices that are connected to the system through the internal [LightBus](http://develop.nanite-systems.com/light_bus) will be within this menu. This mostly refers to our NS Compatibility as most devices from NS use the [LightBus](http://develop.nanite-systems.com/light_bus).

You are able to interact with devices if they allow interaction, otherwise you will only have the option to disconnect them from here, or they can be detached if allowed.
