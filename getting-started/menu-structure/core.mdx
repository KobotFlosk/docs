The **Core** section is where you tailor the unit's cognitive settings, including word replacement, personas, and location history.

### Menu Options

*   **[Filters](/getting-started/menu-structure/core/filters)**: Word replacement settings. These allow certain keywords or phrases to be automatically converted into synthetic-styled language.
*   **[Personas](/getting-started/menu-structure/core/personas)**: Customize the unit's chat tone and quick commands using notecards.
*   **QT History**: A rolling log of the unit's teleport locations for quick access and navigation.
