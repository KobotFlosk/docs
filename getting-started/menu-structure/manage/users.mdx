In this menu you can give people control over your controller, which can be limited or full access.

### Menu Options

*   **List Users**: View users added to your controller and their access levels. Click **Report** to display this in local chat. Users are numbered in the menu; click a number to remove that user.
*   **Add User**: Scans for nearby agents. Selecting a name brings up options to set their access level:
    *   **Owner**: Full access.
    *   **Power**: Intermediate access.
    *   **Basic**: Limited access.
*   **Clear Users**: Removes all users from the controller.
*   **Blacklist/Whitelist**:
    *   **Blacklist**: Blocks specific users from accessing the controller.
    *   **Whitelist**: Grants trusted users access.
    *   Both lists can be cleared from their respective menus.
*   **Consent Toggle**: Turn on/off. If on, you'll get a prompt when someone tries to access your controller, giving you the option to grant temporary access, add them to the user list, or block them.
