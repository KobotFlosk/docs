title: "Designation"

Within the Designation menu, the structure is divided into **NAME** and **LABEL**.

### What is NAME?
The 'Name' refers to the first part of your identity. For example, in `KOR Unit (KOR-50B-00-2705)`, the name is `KOR Unit`.

When you change the **NAME**, you are only changing the first half. Your serial number remains unchanged.
*   **Example**: Changing `KOR Unit` to `Flosk` results in `Flosk (KOR-50B-00-2705)`.

### What is LABEL?
The 'Label' refers to both the **NAME** and the **SERIAL** number. When you change this, it replaces the entire identity.

*   **Example**: Changing `KOR Unit (KOR-50B-00-2705)` to `Flosk` results in just `Flosk`.

<Tip>
  **Label** is useful if you want to use a unique name instead of the pre-generated serial number.
