title: "Personas"
---

Creating a custom persona enhances your chat tone and quick chat lines. The controller includes pre-loaded example personas in the `K_Storage` or `K_Memory` prim, depending on your controller model. These examples can be accessed for reference and modification to help you create your own personalized persona.

### Creating a Persona Notecard
When creating or modifying a persona notecard, it's important to name it correctly. Start with `persona.` followed by a name of your choice. For example, `persona.flosk` or `persona.my persona`. This naming convention ensures that your controller recognizes and correctly processes the notecard for your custom persona settings.

### Customizing Your Persona
* **Talk**: Add elements like 'Talk' for chat tones (sound cues). Insert the UUID of your chosen sound. 
  * Example: `talk | UUID`
* **Quick Chat**: Personalize quick chat commands. 
  * Example: `.command | response`. This allows a typed command like `.ok` to produce a predefined chat response.
  * Example: `.timber | Help I've fallen and can't get up!`

### Uploading to the Controller
1. Access the controller’s edit menu and select **Edit**.
2. Check **Edit Linked** and navigate to the memory component, now labeled `K_Storage` (or `K_Memory` in Trailblazer controllers).
3. In the **Content** tab, add your persona notecard.
4. Activate the controller interface and navigate to the **Personas** section to select your custom persona.

### Loading Custom Personas
To load the persona notecard you created, follow these steps in the menu:
1. Go to the **Core** section in your controller's menu.
2. Navigate to **Personas**.
3. Select the name of the notecard you created (e.g., `persona.flosk` would be shown as `flosk` in the dialog button).

This action activates your custom persona, setting it as the new default. Remember, the name of the notecard you choose here is what determines which persona settings are loaded.
