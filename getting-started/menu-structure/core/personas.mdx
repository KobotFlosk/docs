title: "Personas"

Creating a custom persona enhances your chat tone and quick chat lines. The controller includes pre-loaded example personas in the '**K_Storage**' or '**K_Memory**' prim, depending on your controller model. These examples can be accessed for reference and modification to help you create your own personalized persona. 

Use these as a starting point to understand the format and possibilities, and then tailor them to fit your unique style and preferences.

1. **Creating a Persona Notecard:**
    * When creating or modifying a persona notecard, it's important to name it correctly. Start with 'persona.' followed by a name of your choice. 
    * For example, `persona.flosk` or `persona.my persona`. This naming convention ensures that your controller recognizes and correctly processes the notecard for your custom persona settings.
2. **Customizing Your Persona:**
    * Add elements like 'Talk' for chat tones (sound cues). Insert the UUID of your chosen sound. Example: `talk | UUID`.
    * Personalize quick chat commands. Example: `.command | response`. This allows a typed command like `.ok` to produce a predefined chat response.
    * Example: `.timber | Help I've fallen and can't get up!`
3. **Uploading to the Controller:**
    * Access the controller's edit menu and select 'Edit'.
    * Check '**Edit Linked**' and navigate to the memory component, now labeled '**K_Storage**' (or '**K_Memory**' in Trailblazer controllers).
    * In the '**Content**' tab, add your persona notecard.
    * Activate the controller interface and navigate to the Personas section to select your custom persona.

## Loading Custom Personas

To load the persona notecard you created, follow these steps in the menu:

* Go to the '**Core**' section in your controller's menu.
* Navigate to '**Personas**'.
* Select the name of the notecard you created, like `persona.flosk` would be shown as flosk in the dialog button.

This action activates your custom persona, setting it as the new default. Remember, the name of the notecard you choose here is what determines which persona settings are loaded.
