### Creating Word Replacements

Word Replacements modify how your unit speaks during conversation. These filters allow certain keywords or phrases to be automatically converted into synthetic-styled language. They are useful for flavoring dialog or maintaining character tone consistently across all responses.

The controller supports a set of example replacements that are read from a notecard named: `filters.WR`

You can find the example notecard already loaded in your controller's `K_Storage`, `K_Memory` or `K_Kore` prim depending on your controller model. Use this as a reference to build your own.

#### Format of Word Replacements
Each entry in the notecard follows this format:
`original | replacement`

**Examples:**
Be mindful that replacements are case-sensitive. If you want both “Sorry” and “sorry” to be filtered, list both.

### Creating Your Own Filter Set
To create a custom set, create a new notecard and name it: `filters.[yourname]`

**Example:**
This helps keep alternate word sets separate and organized. These can be swapped by selecting the desired filter set in the controller’s interface.

### Uploading to the Controller
1. Right-click your controller object and choose **Edit**.
2. Check **Edit Linked**, then select the `K_Storage`, `K_Memory` or `K_Kore` prim.
3. Open the **Content** tab.
4. Drop your custom `filters.[yourname]` notecard into the content list.
5. Once added, open the controller’s interface, go to **Filters**, and select your replacement set.
