title: "Filters"
---

Word Replacements modify how your unit speaks during conversation. These filters allow certain keywords or phrases to be automatically converted into synthetic-styled language. They are useful for flavoring dialog or maintaining character tone consistently across all responses.

The controller supports a set of example replacements that are read from a notecard named:

`filters.WR`

You can find the example notecard already loaded in your controller's `K_Storage` , `K_Memory` or `K_Kore` prim depending on your controller model. Use this as a reference to build your own.

**Format of Word Replacements:**

Each entry in the notecard follows this format:

```
original | replacement
```

**Examples:**

```
its | it is
lol | haha
I know | This Kobot knows
Sorry | Kobot apologies
```

Be mindful that replacements are **case-sensitive**. If you want both “Sorry” and “sorry” to be filtered, list both.

**Creating Your Own Filter Set:**

To create a custom set, create a new notecard and name it:

`filters.[yourname]`

**Example:**

```
filters.flosk
```

This helps keep alternate word sets separate and organized. These can be swapped by selecting the desired filter set in the controller’s interface.
