<Warning>
  To fully experience KOR, ensure that [RLV](https://community.secondlife.com/forums/topic/441759-what-is-rlv-how-does-it-work-what-do-i-need-to-make-it-work/) (Restrained Love Viewer) is enabled in your viewer settings. This activates all the advanced features of the system.
</Warning>

## What's included?

When you purchase KOR in-world, your kit comes with several essential components to enhance your Second Life experience:

*   **Battery**: Included with your in-world purchase. If you purchased KOR elsewhere, buy the battery separately.
*   **HUD (Heads-Up Display)**: An interface for controlling your KOR system.
*   **Controller**: The main component that manages the system's functionality.
*   **Overhead Titler**: Displays your unit's information above your avatar's head (optional attachment).

<Note>
  The Overhead Titler and HUD are optional but offer additional features for your experience.
</Note>

## Initial Setup

For the system to function correctly, attach the **Controller** to your avatar's **Spine** and the **Battery** to the **Chest**. This specific configuration is essential for optimal performance.

<Note>
  If you're using our KOR kit (bought in world), the battery is included. If you prefer, Nanite Systems Batteries are also compatible. Some KOR systems have built-in batteries in the controllers, simplifying the process even further.
</Note>

Once the Controller is correctly attached, initiate the system by using the command `!boot` or `|boot`. This will activate the system from the 'Offline State' to 'Online State'. For more detailed instructions and additional commands, refer to our [Command Reference](/getting-started/command-reference) guide.

<Warning>
  If you're using a Nanite Systems Battery, wait for the **probe** process to complete. This ensures the controller accurately reads the battery capacity before you initiate the boot-up. Look for the specific indicator that signals you're ready to boot.
</Warning>

## Customization Instructions

You can modify settings like your unit's name and color scheme through the User Interface or via Second Life dialog menus.

For a detailed understanding of KOR's Menu Structure, see the [menu structure guide](/getting-started/menu-structure).

### Alternative Access Methods

<Note>
  Even without RLV, you have several ways to access the menu:
  *   Wear the HUD.
  *   Click on the back of the controller.
  *   Use `/#### menu` (replacing `####` with the last four digits of your serial number).
</Note>

## Name Customization

To customize your unit's name:

1.  **Open the Menu**: Type `!menu` or `|menu`.
2.  **Find Designation Settings**: Navigate to **Manage** > **Designation**.
3.  **Choose Your Name**: In the Designation menu, you have two options:
    *   **Name**: Changes the first part of your KOR identity. For example, changing 'KOR Unit' to 'Flosk' results in `Flosk (KOR-50B-00-2705)`. Your serial number remains unchanged.
    *   **Label**: Changes both your name and serial number to your chosen value.

## Color Customization

Ready to add a splash of color to your KOR system? It's fun and simple! You can change the colors of four different channels - A, B, C, D, and even ALL. Here’s how:

*   **Direct Commands**: Quickly change colors using commands like `!color a red` or <code>!color a &lt;255, 0, 0&gt;</code>. Replace 'a' with the channel (A, B, C, D, or ALL) and 'red' with your desired color or RGB code.
*   **Menu-Based Customization**: Prefer menus? No problem! Go to **Menu > Manage > Color**. You’ll find buttons labeled 1, 2, 3, 4 for easy color selection:
    *   Button 1 (Primary Color) - This is your main color.
    *   Button 2 (Secondary Color)
    *   Button 3 (Tertiary Color)
    *   Button 4 (Quaternary Color)

<Note>
  Remember, all new KOR users start with 'red' as their primary color.
</Note>

## Subsystems Configuration

This section allows you to tailor various aspects of your unit's functionality, including audio perception, speech capabilities, visual experience, and movement. Each subsystem is a toggle, functioning like an on/off switch, giving you complete control over these critical aspects of your unit. Here's a breakdown of what each subsystem does and how you can use them to enhance your Second Life experience.

*   **Audio**: Toggle 'Audio' on for the unit to hear local chat. When off, the unit cannot hear local chat, enhancing the experience of audio isolation.
*   **Core**: With 'Core' on, the unit can speak freely. Turning it off restricts speech, requiring the use of .commands for communication.
*   **Optics**: Enabling 'Optics' allows the unit to see the world clearly. When off, vision is pixelated, simulating visual impairment.

### Servos Configuration

In the Servos configuration, you control your unit's movement.

*   **Full**: This setting allows your unit to move freely, without any restrictions.
*   **Half**: Choose this to limit certain actions. Your unit won't be able to run, jump, or fly.
*   **Halt**: Activating this stops all movement, keeping your unit stationary.

## Unit Comm. (Unit Communication)

This subsection allows for precise adjustments to how the unit interacts with and navigates the virtual environment, enhancing the overall experience by providing granular control over these specific communication functions.

<Warning>
  Remember, these features rely on RLV being enabled to function correctly. Each toggle provides distinct experiences and controls for your unit.
</Warning>

*   **IMs Trns (Private Message Transmission)**: Enables the unit to send private messages.
*   **IMs Recv (Private Message Receive)**: Allows the unit to receive private messages.
*   **Radar**: Grants the ability to detect other agents nearby.
*   **GPS**: Enables map visibility, allowing the unit to see its location and surroundings.

## Core

The CORE section is where you tailor the unit's cognitive settings, enabling word replacement and customized dot commands through notecards. It houses Personas for chat tone and quick commands customization, alongside QT history, a log of the unit's locations. This area is crucial for personalizing the unit's interaction and communication style, essentially acting as the brain of the system where users can fine-tune how the unit processes and responds to information.
