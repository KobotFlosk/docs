## Overview

This system stands as the sole thin-client based RLV Controller in SL. Designed to overcome the LSL issues prevalent in competitor systems, our focus is to offer a more reliable and stable experience for all users.

Introducing KOR, a next-gen line of Robot/Synthetic RLV Controllers. Our product surpasses the competition in both speed and reliability.

## Key Points

- **Seamless Updates**: Over-The-Air Updating; bug-fixes and updates are a daily occurrence and they are entirely seamless to the end user.
- **100% Thin-Client**: The controller communicates with an external back-end, allowing for seamless operation in SL.
- **Automatic Updates**: No need for manual hardware changes, all system updates are done automatically.
- **High-Performance**: Superior performance and stability achieved through lightweight scripts. Highly adaptable, compatible with nearly all products.
- **Compatibility**: The system is around 95% compatible with all NS (Nanite Systems) products right off the bat.

If you're tired of other systems that don't preserve your settings or simply don't work, consider switching to KOR.

Our innovation extends to a new RLV Relay, crafted with user convenience in mind. It retains your RLV settings across different sims and furniture.
