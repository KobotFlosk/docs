The release of our User Interface (UI)! It is still in BETA but usable for basic setup of your unit, or just as a dashboard. The UI will be updated periodically as the weeks go on with new features for you all to use. For this change anybody with the BYOC kit MUST REPLACE THEIR system.main. Anybody with the standard issue controller it would be EASIER to just replace the controller to make sure all scripts within it are up to date. Failure to update either of those will result in poor performance of the User Interface. Attached in this notice will be the updated HUD with has added prims to take advantage of the UI. Any other information please refer to the wiki, or the SL Group! Everyone will need to reattach their controllers after this update is complete as the system will be unresponsive. It would be recommended to get an update as indicated above to take advantage of the update features, new HUD can be redelivered or grabbed from the SL notice.
